# Model Optimization For Edge Devices

Designed a machine learning model that is concise yet accurate enough for edge computing. 

## Need for developing this kind of model?

The idea of the thesis was to harness the optimum potential from the limited resources of microcontrollers.

## Design
The following block diagram gives a preview of the system design.
